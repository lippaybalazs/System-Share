# System-Share

System Share is (at the moment) a windows application that allows the user to merge the interface of multiple computers on a network.

System Share is currently free, you are only asked to share it with others.

The application was created during the Author's senior year of High School with the goal of acquiring a diploma, which was a success.
Due to the lack of similar applications, the project was debugged, stabilized, and brought up to university standards, then released here.

Due to the nature of being developed by one person, this repository will only be updated with full releases.
